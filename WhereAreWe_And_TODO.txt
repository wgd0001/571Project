# Starting this as just a dumping ground of things still left to do and what's done

# TODO:
   1. Base "obstacle" class
      a. Would be nice to have the collision w/ obstacles in this base class
      b. Probably need a getter for height of the obstacle
	  c. Each child of this should probably handle its own movement (we could do some
	      sort of simple side to side at the base level.. just not sure it's very useful.)
	  
   2. Scenes
      a. Maybe some sort of "Scene Factory" to randomly put our objects into a 
	      level?
	  b. Start Screen
	  c. Credit's / Game Over screens
	  
   3. Child obstacles
   
   
 # Done (ish - a solution has at least been identified)
  - Ball movement / colorization
  - Screen movement
